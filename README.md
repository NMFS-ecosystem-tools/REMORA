# REMORA
REsource Management Option Review and Analysis Tool

This tool currently works with just the MSSPM tool, however, with some updates it could work as a 
display/review engine for other tools.  It must be used in conjunction with the nmfCharts module
which is located in the nmfSharedUtilities repo.

REMORA is a high-level manager review tool. It's a graphics-driven, intuitive review tool that allows
a manager to produce various forecast scenarios quickly, without the need to input complicated data sets.
It uses graphics controls such as interactive plots, dials, and sliders to allow the user to tweak input
parameters in order to run the different scenarios.

After running a scenario, the output plot and table are saved, and may be viewed using the embedded image
viewer tool, VIEWMORA. This tool allows for image playback in an animated fashion by setting a first and
last image and letting the user cycle through the images.
